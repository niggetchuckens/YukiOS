# YukiOS

YukiOS is a custom operating system installation project. It includes scripts to automate the installation and configuration of a fully functional Linux environment with selected tools, desktop environments, and optimizations out of the box.

## Project Structure

- `installer.py`: The main installation script (written in Python) designed for Arch Linux. It automates disk partitioning, base system installation, user creation, and desktop environment setup.
- `install.sh`: A post-installation shell script for setting up additional software, Flatpaks, and custom applications (such as Proteus, XAMPP, and Cisco tools). *Note: This script currently uses `apt` and appears to be targeted at Debian-based systems.*
- `mirrors/`: Contains Python modules to set up third-party repositories like BlackArch and CachyOS.
- `binaries/`: Stores pre-compiled binaries (e.g., `yay.pkg.tar.zst`) for quick installation without compiling from the AUR during setup.

## Technical Details

### Arch Linux Installer (`installer.py`)

The Python installer automates an Arch Linux installation using a series of defined functions to step through the standard Arch installation guide programmatically:

- `run_command()`: A robust helper function to execute shell commands programmatically and halt the installation if critical errors occur.
- `configure_pacman()`: Enhances the package manager by editing `/etc/pacman.conf` to enable `Color`, `ParallelDownloads`, and the hidden `ILoveCandy` easter egg for a better visual experience during installation.
- `set_disks()`: Asks the user for a target drive (e.g., `sda`, `nvme0n1`). It then completely wipes the drive, creates a 1GB EFI (`fat32`) partition for boot and an `ext4` partition for the rest of the root filesystem using `parted`, and automatically mounts them to `/mnt`.
- `install_base()`: Prompts the user to specify their hardware (Intel/AMD CPU and Intel/AMD/NVIDIA GPU). It then dynamically runs `pacstrap` to install the `base`, `linux-firmware`, `base-devel`, network tools, OpenSSH, and the correct microcode/graphics drivers for the chosen hardware. It also generates the `fstab` file.
- `de_select()`: Provides an interactive menu for the user to choose their preferred Desktop Environment or Window Manager. Options include: KDE Plasma, GNOME, XFCE, Hyprland, Sway, or a headless (TTY-only) setup. It maps the selection to the corresponding Arch packages and display manager service (e.g., `sddm`, `gdm`, `lightdm`).
- `base_config()`: The final overarching setup function that handles the `arch-chroot` stage. It manages:
  - Setting the timezone to `America/Santiago` and synchronizing the hardware clock.
  - Setting the system locales to `en_US.UTF-8` and setting the hostname to `YukiOS`.
  - Creating a root password and setting up a new standard user with `wheel` (sudo) privileges.
  - **Third-party Repositories**: Invoking the Python modules from the `mirrors/` folder to install the **BlackArch** penetration testing repository and the **CachyOS** repository. It then installs the optimized `linux-cachyos-lts` kernel.
  - **Bootloader**: Installing `grub` and `efibootmgr`, then configuring GRUB for UEFI.
  - **AUR Helper**: Copying over and installing a pre-compiled `yay` package from the local `binaries/` directory so it is available out of the box.
  - **DE Installation**: Finally, it installs the packages selected in `de_select()`, enables the display manager, NetworkManager, and sshd services, unmounts the drives, and reboots.

### Debian-Based Post-Installation (`install.sh`)

This script serves to bootstrap a machine with additional user-space tools, leveraging Flatpaks and direct downloads from a custom Minio server.

- `user_to_sudoers()`: Dynamically grants password-less `sudo` rights to the active user by adding them to `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
- `install_pkgs()`: Uses `apt` to install development basics (btop, git, openssh). It then initializes `flathub` and installs GUI applications through Flatpak (PortProton, VS Code, OnlyOffice).
- `install_proteus()`: Downloads a custom `proteus.tar.gz` archive from the project's server, extracts it, and creates a Linux `.desktop` entry that launches the Windows application via PortProton seamlessly.
- `install_xampp()`: Automatically downloads and performs an unattended, silent installation of XAMPP via a `.run` binary.
- `install_cisco()`: Downloads and installs the Cisco Packet Tracer via a `.deb` package using `apt`.

## Usage

### Running the Arch Linux Installer
To install YukiOS using the Python installer, boot into an Arch Linux live ISO, ensure you are connected to the internet, and execute:

```bash
python installer.py
```
The script will prompt you for the disk to format, your CPU/GPU manufacturers, your preferred Desktop Environment, and credentials for the new user.

### Post-Installation Apps (Debian-based)
If you are on a Debian-based system (or adapting the script for Arch), you can run the post-installation script to install additional tools and Flatpaks:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Building and Testing the Calamares Live ISO

YukiOS includes an Archiso profile integrated with the **Calamares** graphical installer and a **KDE Plasma 6** live desktop environment (with Brave, Discord, Antigravity IDE, Spotify, and Kitty pre-installed).

#### 1. Build the ISO
```bash
./scripts/build-iso.sh --clean
```
This script compiles the Live ISO into the `out/` directory (e.g., `out/yukios-<date>-x86_64.iso`). Use `--run` to automatically launch QEMU upon build completion.

#### 2. Test in QEMU + KVM
```bash
./scripts/run-qemu.sh
```
This script automatically creates a 25GB virtual disk (`test-vm-disk.qcow2`), enables KVM acceleration and UEFI OVMF firmware, and boots into the live environment. You can test partitioning and installing YukiOS via Calamares.

To boot into the installed system directly from the virtual hard drive:
```bash
./scripts/run-qemu.sh "" installed
```

#### 3. Automated VM Deployment with Terraform
YukiOS provides complete Infrastructure-as-Code automation in the [`terraform/`](terraform/) directory.

You can manage the VM directly using the CLI wrapper script:
```bash
./scripts/manage-vm.sh up                 # Deploy and start installer VM (GTK desktop window)
./scripts/manage-vm.sh up install vnc     # Deploy and start headlessly with VNC at 127.0.0.1:5900
./scripts/manage-vm.sh up installed       # Boot installed system from virtual hard drive
./scripts/manage-vm.sh status             # Check VM running status and PID
./scripts/manage-vm.sh logs -f            # Follow execution logs
./scripts/manage-vm.sh ssh                # SSH into guest (liveuser@localhost:2222)
./scripts/manage-vm.sh down               # Gracefully stop the VM (preserves disk)
```

Or using native Terraform commands:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

See [`terraform/README.md`](terraform/README.md) for full configuration variables (display modes, VNC, SSH port forwarding, and Libvirt module).

## Planned Features

Check the [`todo.md`](todo.md) file for upcoming features and planned improvements, such as:
- Automatic local XAMPP configuration script.
- Pre-compiling PortProton for system-wide installation.
- Installation of programming languages and additional IDEs.
